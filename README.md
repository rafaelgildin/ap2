# ap2_2023s2_lab1

This week I want to share a bit about my journey into c code 🧑‍💻

Simple code just to get started: https://github.com/rafaelgildin/ap2_2023s2_lab1 ⭐

Both codes run approximately the same code, but  for different compilers, so:
- Dv_cpp : dev C++ compiler
- vscode : Visual studio code

Happy for sharing with you🎉
